# Ping Pong Game - Bat Class

This repository contains the `Bat` class, which is a key component of a simple Ping Pong game implemented in Java for Android. The `Bat` class controls the movement of the paddle and ensures it stays within the screen boundaries.

## Features
- Moves left and right based on user input
- Prevents movement beyond screen boundaries
- Updates position based on frame rate (FPS) for smooth motion
- Designed for use in an Android game environment

## How It Works
- The bat is represented as a rectangle (`RectF`).
- Movement speed is calculated based on screen width.
- The `update()` method moves the bat according to its current state (LEFT, RIGHT, or STOPPED).
- Boundary checks prevent the bat from going off-screen.
